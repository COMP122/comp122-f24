# Today's Lecture Material
 
  1. Exercise:  Unicode to UTF-8 encoding
  1. Practicum: Unicode to UTF-8 encoding
     - read unicode index (read_x();)
     - determine position of msb
     - determine number of bytes
       - chunk into new bytes
       - add framing bits
       - output 

  1. Exercise:  UTF-8 decoding
  1. Practicum: UTF-8 decoding
     - read first byte  ( read_x();)
     - read additional bytes
     - validate additional bytes
     - strip framing bits
     - merge data bits
     - output unicode index
