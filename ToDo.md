Ideas for the Fall...

1. In mapping section bring up 
   - variables to locations in memory
   - variables to frames

1. Exercise in Mapping section
   - Talk about  "my stuff" and "common"  stuff -- apartment: bedroom versus kitchen
   - enumarate all the variables you have and organize them somehow
     - formal, locals, class, constants/final
   - enumerate all of the registers into groups
      - (reserved: gp, at, k1, k2), T-s, S-es, a-s, v-s, fp, sp


Activiation Records Lecture
   - use Miro
   - have a scattering of formals and locals
   - have a scattering of registers
   - group them
   - talk about the catagors: 
       - location: shared vurses private: 
       - value: shared vurses private: 

   - reorganize the stuff into a box: i.e., a activation frame
