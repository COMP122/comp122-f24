## Grade guesstimator[^1]
This tool provides a guesstimate of your final grade--based upon a number of assumptions.
Such assumptions may not come to fluition!  Hence, this tool can only be used to provide 
the student with an guesstimate of what their final grade _might_ be.

[^1]: This tool is now deprecated. It remains within the repo as a reference.

#### Installation

1. Install an appropriate program to display a Mardown file.
   - For example, One Markdown: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/one-markdown/id1507139439
   - You can view the output file via a text editor, but the alignment of values within a table may be off.

   - `cd /Users/steve/classes/comp122`
   - `cp etc/grade_guesstimator.defaults deliverables/grade_guesstimator.defaults`

#### Setup
