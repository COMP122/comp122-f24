# The basic algorithm
#    1. pull the class-material repo
#    2. pull the mars-mips repo
#    3. for each assignment in the deliverables directory
#        * pull the assignment
# Note that git allows you to _temporarily_ change the 
#    working directory with the "-C" option
#    Hence, the following command can be used to pull repository
#    without first changing your working directory
#
#    git -C <path> pull
